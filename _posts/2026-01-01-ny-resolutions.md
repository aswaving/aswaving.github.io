# Rusty New Year's resolutions

In 2026 I want to create 
- a constraint solving library like [choco](https://choco-solver.org/).
- an automata theory library like [brics](https://www.brics.dk/automaton/) or [libfa](https://augeas.net/libfa/index.html) with a DSL to specify automata.
- a process framework for distributed communicating processes (with high-availability and scalability options, like fail-over and load-balancing).
